# TheMonkees Website

A fully responsive website for a legendary Band called 'TheMonkees'. The website acts as a hub for the Band to reach out to their adoring fans.

## UX

From the brief: "The band is a 1960â€™s rock band and have around 50 years experience of performing live at numerous events around the world.
Their primary target audiences are their fans and potential fans who wish to use the site to see and hear clips from their back catalog, and any new material as it becomes available.
Also, the band would like to use the site to showcase their music and publicise their availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas parties."

From the above project brief, I have come up with the following user stories:

- As a fan I would like Look at Band Pictures/Artwork
- As a fan I would like to Listen to the Band's music
- As a fan I would like to be able to contact the Band regarding performing at events i.e. Weddings, Christmas parties etc.
- Provide links to Band social media: Facebook, Twitter & YouTube Pages.

### Mockups

Initial mockups were made using **Balsamiq** software to aid in the creation of the website; a basic mockup was made of each web page. 
- The mockups can be found in the **Mockups** folder. 

## Features
- Music - allow Fans to listen to Band music, by navigating to the 'Listen' page.
- Pictures/Artwork - allow fans to look at Band pictures/artwork, by navigating to the 'Look' page.
- Booking Enquiries - allow fans to contact the Band regarding bookings for private events. This is done by navigating to the 'Book' page and filling out the contact form.
  - Also, this is advertised in the footer of the 'Home', 'Look' and 'Listen' pages. 
- Social Media links - allow fans to access links to Band social media by providing links on all Website pages. Links have been provided at the bottom of every single page under the 'OUR SOCIALS' section in the footer.

    1. Go to the "Look" page.
    2. Observe if all images display correctly.
    3. Observe images are positioned correctly i.e. no overlapping of images etc.

	4. Follow steps 2 - 3 for all pages. Is the the typography consistent across all pages? Is it readable on small screen devices?

### Screen Size & Different Browsers

#### Screen Sizes

Using the Debugger tools on Google Chrome I was able to view the website in different screen sizes. The following screen sizes were verified:
- 360px X 640px (WxH)
- 768px X 1024px (WxH)
- 1024px X 1366px (WxH)

Test's were run for various screen sizes, these are listed in the above **Testing** section.

On smaller screen sizes i.e. when the width is 768px or less, the website switches to a stacked view to maintain a consistent look.

#### Multi Browser Testing

Multi browser testing was carried out to ensure there is consistency across different Browsers. The following Browsers were tested:
- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Microsoft Edge
- Internet Explorer v11 - The 'Listen' page doesn't work well with IE v11; the audio doesn't seem to load and throws an error. A note has been made to let users know to avoid using this browser.
